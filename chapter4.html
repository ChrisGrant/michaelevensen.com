            <h2>Stream and Search</h2> 


<p>For our sound items in the Stream that meant removing a lot of superflous information. Where sound items in the Stream previously looked like this:</p>




<p>Sound items in the Stream.While this informed users about all statistics of the track it also helped to confuse users about the most important thing related to playback: “How much information do I need before I choose to play a track or playlist?” It also added an increasing amount of elements that new users had to wrap their heads around. What we chose to focus on were five simple things:</p>


  <ul>
    <li>Artwork.</li>
    <li>Username of uploader / creator.</li>
    <li>Track or Playlist title.</li>
    <li>Tag and genre.</li>
    <li>Repost if the track had been reposted, with a fallback to play count.</li>
  </ul>




<p>For Playlist representation we substituted tag and genre with total track count and length of playlist:</p>








<h2>Profiles A human touch </h2>


<p>With profile representation we also had to consider the information hierarchy. We wanted the profiles to come across as something simple and more importantly something human, moving away from a representation that looked it was taken out of a database. Numbers, statistics and interaction points had to be simplified.</p>





<p>Old SoundCloud profiles.The need to logically structure the impression of a profile was done through focusing on the most important aspects and then figuring out a logical content hierarchy. One of the key ideas in the app as a whole was to focus on playback, and drive users into a successful playback experience and this became the staple for our profiles as well. We chose to focus on two things above everything else: </p>

<ul>
<li>Playback</li>
<li>Follow interactions.</li>
</ul>

<p>As with the Player we wanted to create a simple first impression, but still maintain some of the more detailed interactions that could be done on a profile. </p>





<p>Updated SoundCloud profiles.This attitude of a simple first impression became somewhat of a rule for the rest of the product process. Always trying to radically simplify and think about it in human terms: “How could you explain this to someone with as few words as possible?”</p>

<h2>You </h2>


<p>With You the approach was similar. We saw a clear majority use-case happening on the older You. </p>




<p>Old YouPeople were actively (amounted for about 60% of usage on You) reengaging with their previously liked content. The Likes tab was being used far more than any other tab on the You page, without even being optimized for that use. The goal was to leverage the most commonly used interaction and elevate playlists given their ability to enable easy access to long listening sessions. </p>





<p>New YouWe also wanted to focus on functionality and content rather than presentation, removing the profile image and your own stats and moving some of this over to what we called the “More” tab. The idea was to create a access-to-content first and detailed, managed information second, where the “More” tab contained Following Lists, Settings and other information and features related to more in-depth control of your own profile.</p>
