              <p>SoundCloud’s mobile-past had been a turbulent one, with an attitude of: <em>if we can build it then let’s include it.</em> The product had evolved from a simple stripped-down  foundation, into a set of feature-rich and extremely encompassing applications. All these features added over the years had resulted in a very unclear mobile product — who was this tailored for? And what main use-case was at the core of the product? </p>


              <p>We saw that we needed to take mobile seriously, way more serious than it had been considered in the past. SoundCloud was realizing the potential and necessity to tackle mobile as a key component to future growth, and as a more substantial and unique part of the SoundCloud ecosystem. And there was a need to focus on an uniquely identifiying mobile experience (without being too removed in terms of visual and functional consistency from other platforms), treating mobile as a singular holistic experience. Some of the questions we were asking ourselves were: </p>

              <ul>
                <li>What features are unique to mobile? And how can we make the most out of these features?</li>
                <li>How can we make the best possible mobile experience for our users?</li>
                <li>And how do we clearly communicate what Mobile SoundCloud is all about?</li>

              </ul>

              <h2>Scaling up</h2>


              <p>Almost four years since it’s original launch, the assessment of growing the app at scale had finally become a reality. There was a huge overhead related to maintaining the code-base, and the introduction of new features increased in complexity for every iteration. Things were slowing down, and things were getting more difficult to work with rather than simpler. </p>

               <p>Technically, the base of the product was a mess, and after years of avoiding some of the core problems the product was facing, there was a hard to choice to be made whether or not the idea of starting from scratch was something to be considered. After months of debate and discussion, the choice was made that in order for the product to be where SoundCloud wanted it to be, serving a vast majority of all plays on the platform, we needed to start a much bigger project involving removing the legacy that we were struggling with. This couldn’t be done in isolation or module per module, given the fact of how the code base was structured, so the conclusion was drawn that if we were to take mobile seriously, both product– and technically, we needed to start fresh.

              We saw this as an amazing opportunity. Not only could we start from the ground up defining a vision for what mobile should and could be, but we also had the possibility to work closely with the engineers in defining that future.</p>

              <h2>... and growing up</h2>


              <p>Originally coming from a core user base that had been mostly creators, music makers and DJs, SoundCloud was going through a change. Since it’s original inception, the user base had grown from a dedicated small community of creators to a majority of listeners — who weren’t actively uploading audio or music— but used SoundCloud purely as a listening service.</p>
