            <section class="intro">
            
              <p class="introduction">The idea behind this post is to give some insights into parts of our process and highlight some of the narrative leading up to the launch of SoundCloud’s updated iPhone app. I recently left SoundCloud to pursue future endeavours, more about that <a href="http://www.michaelevensen.com" target="_blank">here.</a></p>

              <p>My story starts with a set of late-night prototypes—made together with the amazingly talented <a href="http://www.twitter.com/kasperlahti" target="_blank">Kasper Lahti</a>—trying out some mobile ideas we had been discussing for a while. We were both eager, and curious as to how some of the existing paradigms for SoundCloud mobile could evolve. Originally being apart of the web team, we both moved to the mobile team as part of a bigger internal shift, where SoundCloud was realizing the potential and necessity to tackle mobile as a key component to future growth, and as a more substantial and unique part of the SoundCloud ecosystem.</p>

            <h2>The past</h2>
              <p>SoundCloud’s mobile-past had been a turbulent one, with an attitude of: <em>if we can build it then let’s include it.</em> The product had evolved from a simple stripped-down  foundation, into a set of feature-rich and extremely encompassing applications. All these features added over the years had resulted in a very unclear mobile product — who was this tailored for? And what main use-case was at the core of the product? </p>


              <p class="small-quote">&#8220;... who was this tailored for? And what main use-case was at the core of the product?&#8221;</p>


              <p>With the move to mobile, we continued our discussions about what makes the SoundCloud mobile experience unique, and we wanted to challenge some of the pre-existings concepts for how audio and music functioned on SoundCloud’s mobile platforms.</p>

              <p>We saw that we needed to take mobile seriously, way more serious than it had been considered in the past. There was a need to focus on an uniquely identifiying mobile experience (without being too removed in terms of visual and functional consistency from other platforms), treating mobile as a singular holistic experience. Some of the questions we were asking ourselves were: </p>

              <ul>
                <li>What features are unique to mobile? And how can we make the most out of these features?</li>
                <li>How can we make the best possible mobile experience for our users?</li>
                <li>And how do we clearly communicate what Mobile SoundCloud is all about?</li>

              </ul>

              <h2>Scaling up</h2>


              <p>Almost four years since it’s original launch, the assessment of growing the app at scale had finally become a reality. There was a huge overhead related to maintaining the code-base, and the introduction of new features increased in complexity for every iteration. Things were slowing down, and things were getting more difficult to work with rather than simpler. </p>


            </section>

            </div>


              <span class="box left">

                 <span class="small-quote">“... there was a hard to choice to be made whether or not the idea of starting from scratch was something to be considered.”</span>
                
                  
              </span>


              <div class="story">

               <p>Technically, the base of the product was a mess, and after years of avoiding some of the core problems the product was facing, there was a hard to choice to be made whether or not the idea of starting from scratch was something to be considered. After months of debate and discussion, the choice was made that in order for the product to be where SoundCloud wanted it to be, serving a vast majority of all plays on the platform, we needed to start a much bigger project involving removing the legacy that we were struggling with. This couldn’t be done in isolation or module per module, given the fact of how the code base was structured, so the conclusion was drawn that if we were to take mobile seriously, both product– and technically, we needed to start fresh.

              We saw this as an amazing opportunity. Not only could we start from the ground up defining a vision for what mobile should and could be, but we also had the possibility to work closely with the engineers in defining that future.</p>


            <section class="growing-up">
              
              <h2>... and growing up</h2>


              <p>Originally coming from a core user base that had been mostly creators, music makers and DJs, SoundCloud was going through a change. Since it’s original inception, the user base had grown from a dedicated small community of creators to a majority of listeners — who weren’t actively uploading audio or music— but used SoundCloud purely as a listening service.</p>


               <span class="quote-text right">

                 <span class="quote">“The reality was that the vast majority of users were actively listening and building a library of <em>Likes</em> and <em>Playlists ...</em>”</span>
                  
              </span>

              <p>The reality was that the vast majority of users were actively listening and building a library of Likes and Playlists and creator-specific features like Record and the Activity Feed were being under-utilized. There was a clear need to refocus some of the internal priorities after years of leveraging features and functionality catered to creators. <em>We had to put the listener in the front seat.</em></p>

              <h2>Identifying the experiences</h2>


              <p>With the listener in focus, and a possibility to build around some of the most common use cases, we started identifying some of the experiences that were going to be the foundation for the product.</p>

              <p>The older app consisted of seven main experiences:</p>

                  </li>

               </ul>

                <small>* Although with Record not being in the tab bar, it’s a feature that included a fair share of functionality. I’m therefore including it as one of the main experiences.</small>
