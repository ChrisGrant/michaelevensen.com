<p>Tackling the problems of presenting music and profiles in different forms, we realised that one of the most important experiences we had to solve was audio playback. Given the fact that it was an audio app, the possibility to easily manage and control your playback experience was one  the most important factors.</p>

<p>In terms of audio interfaces things haven’t really changed that much since the invention of the stereo. The definition of what it means to interact with audio has barely changed when it’s been translated from the physical world to the digital, and more importantly in the translation from computers to mobile devices. From stereos with buttons related to controlling specific features …</p>





<p>Stereo Interface… to desktop and audio playback software. </p>

<p>… and from Desktop software to Mobile devices.</p>

              <figcaption>______</figcaption>

            </figure>





<p>… except for removing the physical buttons, the interface and features have stayed mostly the same.</p>

<h2>Problems</h2> 


<p>Although these interfaces offer a great way of controlling all aspects of playback, if you start thinking about these in mobile terms, there’s some inherent problems:</p>

  <ul>

    <li>All controls are always visible. Sometimes crowding the interface with irrelevant buttons and UI. On a mobile device every area of the available canvas is precious.</li>
    <li>They’ve been adapted from working in the physical world  or on a computer where you have the possibility to press a button or have very nimble control with a pointer. When you pair this with a crowded UI, interaction becomes fairly difficult.</li>
    <li>More importantly, they’re not mobile optimised — far from it. Where the use of gestures are so deeply established and integrated in how people use their smart phones, small hit targets and intricate intercations don’t make sense. Scrubbing a small bullet point on a thin timeline, or tapping a little pause button in between four other buttons, while on the go isn’t the greatest experience for playing music on a smart phone.</li>

  </ul>

<p>In terms of presenting a complicated audio interface, SoundCloud was no different. All the interactions that could be done in the previous Player were:
</p>


<ul>

<li>Go to the Profile of the currently playing user.</li>
<li>See Statistics for track.</li>
<li>Like.</li>
<li>Re-post.</li>
<li>Add to Playlist.</li>
<li>Share.</li>
<li>Read track information.</li>
<li>Go to the the Profile of the user who added a comment.</li>
<li>Seeking / Scrubbing the track.</li>
<li>Previous Track.</li>
<li>Pause / Play</li>
<li>Next Track.</li>
<li>Add a comment</li>

</ul>

<h2>A simpler playback experience </h2>


<p>We wanted to change this. What we wanted was a simple, but yet feature-rich, mobile optimized, playback experience. Given the fact that we couldn’t strip away basic features like Play / Pause, Previous and Next and some of the main engagements, the idea was to divide the functionality related to actual use and emphasis. Presenting the player initially as something really simple, then secondly allowing for detailed control of playback. What we also wanted was to make something that specifically worked for the platform it was being built for — mobile. We wanted to create a unique mobile audio playback interface, heavily utilizing gestures (something that users already were accustomed to while using their iPhones). And we wanted the first impression of the playback experience to be understood as something extremely simple. </p>

<p>We wanted to create a unique mobile audio playback interface, 
heavily utilizing gestures ...</p>

<p>Our goal was to get away from an intimidating interface (allowing 13 things to happen at the same time), while still wanting to retain some of the more advanced functionality related to controlling playback.</p>

<h2>Immersive experience </h2>


<p>What we quickly realized was that for us to be able to utilize all of the gestures and interactions we wanted to include, we had to create some space — a canvas for interaction. Moving away from small isolated areas that controlled playback we wanted to use the full mobile screen size to enable us to include all of the features needed, but also to add things with extra value to the content. We went fullscreen. </p>

<p>Our goal was to make something immersive that focused purely on the listening experience, devoid of any interruptions. When you’re listening to music and audio on your mobile phone it usually is somewhere away from you. Apps and services that require you to browse or look at the screen are very different from an audio app. The use-case being that you mostly have your phone in one of two places while listening to music:</p>


<ul>

<li>In your pocket while listening through earbuds or headphones.</li>
<li>Connected to a stereo or sound system.</li>

</ul>

<p>Not excluding the act of finding something to listen to, we wanted to seperate the two and define discovery as something separate from listening. The idea was that instead of focusing on solving for two parallell processes; actively finding music and listening, instead focus on creating the best possible experience for each individual mode.  </p>

<h2>Getting there </h2>


<p>From the start we had a general idea for what we wanted the player to be. But we didn’t have a clear picture about how to emphasize the different types of controls and information we wanted to include. We knew that we wanted to include basic playback controls, but we were unsure about whether or not to inform users about what part of the playback experience they were currently at. Specifically what we struggled with was a case of informing to much versus informing too little. Initially we tried to include things like: upcoming track(s), information about the user, track information etc.</p> 

<!-- Figure -->
            <figure>


              <figcaption>______</figcaption>

            </figure>


<p>Some of the approaches we had for showing up next items were overly complicated and proved to confuse more than inform.</p> 

<p>Other approaches tried to set the context of what type of music or audio you were playing, in this case specifically related to the information about the track. </p>



            <figure>


              <figcaption>______</figcaption>

            </figure>


<p>In the end, after countless of user tests, we realized that all this information actually made users more disoriented than informed. For instance, trying to expose the playback trajectory made users try to figure out what was going on and what context they were playing the track in. The more we informed, the more confused users were of the context of the content. What we found was that with  music you don’t really need to know what the 10 next (or previous) tracks are, given that it’s so easy to simply change track or change trajectory. </p>

<p>The more we informed, the more confused users were of the context of the content. </p>

<p>In the end what we arrived at a right mix of engagements, information and interactions.</p>



            <figure>


              <figcaption>______</figcaption>

            </figure>





<h2>Gestures and Interaction </h2>


<p>One of the things we worked with excessively was getting the interactions just right. Utilizing gestures became one of the most important things in solving the player. Given the fact that we had all this canvas to let the user control the experience, instead of showing small buttons and interactions for playback we wanted to use the entire screen. Simply tapping on the artwork played or paused the track.</p>

       
            <figure>


              <figcaption>______</figcaption>

            </figure>

<p>The result was two modes of playback; playing and pause. Each containing a lot of the the same controls, but different in visualization. This was to clearly communicate which mode you were in. Initially we included a play / pause button and previous and next buttons also on the playing mode, but we wanted to teach users that they could use the entire canvas to control playback so the choice was made to isolate these controls to pause-mode only.</p>

<p>To change tracks you simply swiped either left or right to the previous or next track.</p>


            <figure>


              <figcaption>______</figcaption>

            </figure>


<p>The last feature we had to solve for was seeking within a track. Since we were leveraging SoundCloud’s symbolic waveform we thought that instead of including a small timeline with a current position-indicator we could use the waveform to intuitvely control seeking. With your current position always being centered on the screen and moving the waveform with your finger would move you backwards or forwards in the track.</p>


            <figure>


              <figcaption>______</figcaption>

            </figure>





<h2>Focus on Like </h2>


<p>One of the things that we were driving in the rest of the application, through the You experience and Profiles, were Likes. We wanted to equally emphasize this in the player itself. Instead of exposing confusing Re-posting symbols (which new users thought was replay or looping the track) we chose to heavily emphasize the simplest of the engagements, namely Like. Without removing all the other interactions, but simply de-emphasizing them slightly, placing them under a “More” menu. </p>

 <figure>


              <figcaption>______</figcaption>

            </figure>


<p>The “More” menu also proved to add extra canvas to the player and isolate it away from the canvas that we were using for playback control. The thought was that we would include any potential future functionality as part of the “More” menu.</p>

<h2>Focal point of the app </h2>


<p>In the end the player became the focal point for the app. Everything we built, we built around the player …*</p>
