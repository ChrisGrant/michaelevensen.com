          <h2>Changing existing paradigms take a lot of time</h2> 

<p>When we first started we were so eager to challenge everything. Not only were we going to build a product from ground up, but we were going to redefine what Navigation for a mobile device meant to! There are definite gains to be had with setting the bar high, because in the end you might reach half-way to a very optimistic goal which leaves you with something great, but (and there’s a huge but here) don’t try to change some of the things you get for free. There’s a certain balance that needs to be met, challenge the parts of product that are essential to making that product great, and in our case that wasn’t Navigation, it was the Player. </p>

<p>- trying to reinvent the wheel for every feature (even search) is very rewarding but can confuse the clarity in the product. especially when it comes to launching a new product (which was almost the case). we wanted to get the users to understand and to find an easy answer to the question “what is soundcloud for my smart phone about?”, not explain all its great features. </p>

<h2>You can’t push innovation in all parts of the product </h2>


<p>Like with Navigation we had illusions of grandeur for all other parts of the app. Stream was going to be something utterly revolutionary — a new way of experiencing a feed, profiles were going to blow people away etc. We spent a lot of time fighting against some the mobile legacy that was in place. We wanted everything to be innovative and every part of the app to be something unseen. What we saw was that working in isolation on individual experiences, trying to push innovation in every thing we did, as a whole the app became disconnected, there was no red thread going through it, no focal point. Towards the end of the process it became very clear — what the app was about, was playback, it just took us a long time to realize that. In the end this realization of focusing on one part innovation and one part legacy helped us to focus our efforts. The app was going to be about playing relevant and long listening sessions in the player every other experience around the player should just be as simple as possible.</p>

<p>focus on pushing innovation in some of the most important parts of a product, and have other parts support that innovation. in our case it was the player. </p>

<h2>Pros and cons of innovation</h2>


<p>Innovation always has it’s costs. To get users to understand something unconventional takes a lot of effort and time. With our Player we worked tirelessly to build something that wasn’t only new, but that was better, more natural and easier to use on a smartphone. We saw through countless of user-tests that even when boiled down to the simplest elements of our idea, that users still were struggling with things like: opening and closing the player and changing tracks. It takes time for users to adapt, but in the end if it adds a long term benefit to the users and actually improves usage then I’m all for it. </p>

<h2>Killing your darlings </h2>

<p>There were so many features that we didn’t include but had great ideas for. But in the end to make a focused product you need to “kill your darlings”, removing, strip down and focus. For us to be able to inform users what this app was all about we needed to clarify this in terms of features, and we needed to clarify it to ourselves. </p>

<p>Some of these ideas kept circulating internally, occasionally popping up in discussions about newer features, so even if these ideas never make it to the final product they still serve as points of reference and inspiration for what to do next or more importantly what to not do next.</p> 


<h2>Thanks </h2>

<p>Finally, I want to give a massive round of thanks to everyone involved in launching one of the greatest products I’ve ever helped build: </p>

<ul>
  <li>I want to eternally thank Kasper Lahti for a mountain of prototypes, rapid iterations and for working faster than I thought was humanly possible. You made this app be what it is today and without your insights we wouldn’t have made one of the most beautiful playback experiences there is.</li>
  <li>Amir Shaikh, without you and your openness as a Product Manager, this project wouldn’t have been possible. You made this happen and we just happily joined you for the ride.</li>
  <li>Eric Wahlforss. For being the greatest most hands on CTO I’ve ever had the chance to work with. You allowed us to create, to push forward and to innovate, and I thank you for that.</li>
  <li>To everyone else: Aurelie, Sarah, Vincent, Michael, Jon, Robb, Jan, the amazing SoundCloud Design Team — Thanks! Without you this couldn’t have happened!</li>

</ul>
