              <p>The reality was that the vast majority of users were actively listening and building a library of Likes and Playlists and creator-specific features like Record and the Activity Feed were being under-utilized. There was a clear need to refocus some of the internal priorities after years of leveraging features and functionality catered to creators. 


              <blockquote>We had to put the listener in the front seat.</blockquote>

               

              <h2>Identifying the experiences</h2>


              <p>With the listener in focus, and a possibility to build around some of the most common use cases, we started identifying some of the experiences that were going to be the foundation for the product.</p>

              <p>The older app consisted of seven main experiences:</p>


              <ul>
                <li>Stream — A feed of tracks and playlists from people you followed.</li>
                <li>You — Quick access to your own profile.</li>
                <li>Search — Find tracks, playlists and profiles.</li>
                <li>Activity Feed — An activity feed listing all activity related to you. This could be new followers, comments on tracks etc.</li>
                <li>Playback— The playback experience.</li>
                <li>More — All other functionality. </li>
                <li>Record—Record, Edit and Share.*</li>

              </ul>

            <p>Although with Record not being in the tab bar, it’s a feature that included a fair share of functionality. I’m therefore including it as one of the main experiences.</p>

<p>When looking at some of these main experiences with the listener as the main use-case we saw that:</p>


<ul>


<li><em>Stream</em> — Required a fair amount of engagement and understanding. The Stream not being populated without Followers, it required users to not only understand the concept of having to Follow users to see updates, but it also required them to understand the concept and difference of Tracks, Playlists and Reposted Tracks and Playlists. This idea of a simple entry into the app, the mobile use case of starting a listening sessions quickly, and a gradual level of engagement really didn’t match up with how the Stream was implemented. Things like statistics on tracks and playlists added to it’s complexity.</li>

<li><em>You</em> — Borrowing from the design of all other profiles, “You” had been optimized for the exact same usage as with profiles, but was being used in a very different way.  Compared to normal profiles we saw that Likes made up almost 60% of all usage. While profiles were about discovery and finding new content, “You” was about reconsumption.</li>

<li><em>Activity Feed</em>—Seeing that activities mostly happened through Following-actions and comments on Posts (uploaded Tracks and Playlists) the Activity Feed usually didn’t update regularly. It seemed illogical to dedicate one fourth of the main navigation to something that usually didn’t see more use than once or twice per week. </li>

<li><em>Playback</em>—See section on the Player.</li>

<li><em>Record</em>—Record and editing were pure creator features. Having been added onto the app after it’s original inception, Record constituted an app of it’s own, both in terms of Product-scope but also in terms of technical complexity.</li>


</ul>

<h2>Clarification </h2>


<p>It quickly became clear that for us to even get close to a final product (and not just a set of awesome prototypes) we had to figure out what was at the core of the product and everything that didn’t support that core had to be considered closely. </p>

<blockquote>What’s at the core of the product?</blockquote>

<p>Now that we had this amazing opportunity to properly define what SoundCloud was, one of our main goals was to consider every bit of product legacy. With every experience, feature, detail, even all the way down to showing stats for sound items (content items in the Stream and Search), we were asking ourselves: “Does it really need to be there?” And if so: “Why?” </p>

<p>With the app being so muddled in its messaging, sitting right between serving for the creator and the listener, we saw a need to boil it down to four simple experiences all supporting the core-use case. With a strong need to greatly simplify some of the experiences, focused on getting the most important experiences right and then building from that. What we wanted to start with was four key-experiences in the product:</p>

<ul>

<li>Explore and Discover. Find new music relevant to you.</li>
<li>You and your own Collection. Easy reconsumption of content.</li>
<li>Search.</li>
<li>Playback.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Just enough</h2>


<p>As SoundCloud was coming from a history of catering for creators, there was a legacy of loading the UI with information and engagement. For sound items that were apart of the Stream, Search results and Profiles the details and information could sometimes be overwhelming. If we were to also think about how the product communicates to new, inexperienced users, we had to start considering just what type of information we were going to highlight and present.</p>

<p>What this resulted in was a careful consideration of which types of statistics, numbers, engagements and key elements to include in the UI. One example was the sound items, where information like comment, share, and reposting count all added up to having to understanding what each of these individual numbers and symbols meant.</p>

<p>We stripped down the sound items to some of the main engagements we were driving in the rest of the app (Like as an example), and chose to focus on including just enough information to inform playback.</p>
